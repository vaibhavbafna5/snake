# Snake

An implementation of the game snake in Rust, designed to be played on a microbitV2.

This project was used as an introduction to the embedded Rust ecosystem following completion of the vanilla introduction to Rust.
It's very much still a work-in-progress, but major functionality is there.

Current functionality:
* read directional input from serial
* move the snake around (and turns will persist)
* eating "nuggets" works and the snake will enlargen

Future work:
* read the accelerometer to control the direction the snake moves
* restart the game automatically on "death"
* address warnings generated by compiler

### Building & Flashing
1. Buy the hardware
2. Clone the repo
3. Install dependencies (`cargo install --path .`)
4. Build & flash (`cargo embed --features v2 --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf`)

### Playing
I run MacOS, so I use minicom to open a serial interface to the microbitV2.

1. Run `ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*` to find the device identifier (should look something like `/dev/cu.usbmodem2102`)
2. To open the port, run `minicom -D /dev/cu.usbmodem2102 -b 115200`
3. And then to move the snake around, use the `i, j, k, l` keys
